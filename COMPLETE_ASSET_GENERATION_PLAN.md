**Enhancement Workflow:**
1. **Start with source photo** (if available)
2. **Use fal.ai/flux-image-1.5/edit** for:
   - Background replacement (neutral gray #F5F5F5)
   - Lighting enhancement (soft, professional)
   - Color correction (natural skin tones)
   - Slight retouching (professional, not over-edited)

**Why This Works:**
- Consistent style = **professional, cohesive brand**
- Direct eye contact = **trust, connection**
- Neutral background = **focus on person, not setting**
- Approachable expression = **accessible leadership**

**Team Section Layout:**
```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│ [Headshot]   │ [Headshot]   │ [Headshot]   │
│ John Doe     │ Jane Smith   │ Alex Johnson │
│ CEO          │ CTO          │ Design Lead  │
│ LinkedIn →   │ LinkedIn →   │ LinkedIn →   │

#### CTA Visual 1: Primary Button Gradient
```
CSS Implementation:
.cta-primary {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1E9FF2 0%, #5FDFDF 100%);
  color: white;
  padding: 18px 36px;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: 600;
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(30, 159, 242, 0.3);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.cta-primary::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: -100%;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, transparent, rgba(255,255,255,0.3), transparent);
  transition: left 0.6s;
}

.cta-primary:hover::before {
  left: 100%;
}

.cta-primary:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 30px rgba(30, 159, 242, 0.4);
}
```

**Text Options:**
- "Get Started" (generic)
- "View Portfolio →" (specific)
- "Schedule Demo" (high-intent)
- "Request Pricing" (bottom-funnel)

#### CTA Visual 2: Secondary Button (Outline)
```
CSS:
.cta-secondary {
  background: transparent;
  color: #1E9FF2;
  border: 2px solid #1E9FF2;
  padding: 16px 34px;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: 600;
  border-radius: 12px;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.cta-secondary:hover {
  background: #1E9FF2;
  color: white;
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(30, 159, 242, 0.2);
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Paired with primary CTA (hero section)
- Less critical actions (Learn More, Download)
- Alternative pathways

#### CTA Visual 3: Floating Action Button
```
Implementation: Fixed position button
Position: Bottom-right corner
Behavior: Appears after 50% scroll, hides on hero
Animation: Pulse effect to draw attention

CSS:
.cta-floating {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 30px;
  right: 30px;
  background: #1E9FF2;
  color: white;
  padding: 16px 32px;
  border-radius: 50px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 30px rgba(30, 159, 242, 0.4);
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
  z-index: 999;
}

.cta-floating.visible {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}

.cta-floating::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 8px;
  right: 8px;
  width: 10px;
  height: 10px;
  background: #5FDFDF;
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: pulse 2s infinite;
}

@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
  50% { transform: scale(1.5); opacity: 0; }
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Sticky CTA = **always accessible**
- Pulse animation = **attention-grabbing**
- Bottom-right = **thumb-friendly on mobile**

#### CTA Visual 4: Banner Alert (Time-Sensitive)
```
Implementation: Top banner for announcements
Use Case: "Limited spots for Q1 consulting"
Design: Full-width banner above header

HTML:
<div class="cta-banner">
  <div class="container">
    <span class="banner-icon">🚀</span>
    <span class="banner-text">
      <strong>New:</strong> AI Strategy Workshop - Only 3 spots left for Q1
    </span>
    <button class="banner-cta">Apply Now →</button>
    <button class="banner-close">×</button>
  </div>
</div>

CSS:
.cta-banner {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #1E9FF2 0%, #5FDFDF 100%);
  color: white;
  padding: 12px 0;
  text-align: center;
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  z-index: 1000;
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Urgency (limited spots) = **FOMO trigger**
- Sticky positioning = **persistent visibility**
- Easy to dismiss (X button) = **non-intrusive**

#### Step 1: Optimization
```bash
# Convert PNG to WebP (better compression)
cwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp

# Or batch convert
for img in *.png; do
  cwebp -q 85 "$img" -o "${img%.png}.webp"
done
```

#### Step 2: Responsive Sizes
```bash
# Create responsive versions (ImageMagick)
convert input.png -resize 1280x720 output-mobile.png
convert input.png -resize 1920x1080 output-tablet.png
convert input.png -resize 2560x1440 output-desktop.png
```

#### Step 3: Verification
```bash
# Check file sizes (target: <500KB for backgrounds)
ls -lh *.webp

# Check color accuracy
exiftool image.png | grep Color

# Check dimensions
identify *.png
```
