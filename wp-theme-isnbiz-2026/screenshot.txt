PLACEHOLDER: Create a 1200x900px PNG screenshot of the theme homepage.

WordPress recommends 1200x900px for theme screenshots (displays at 400x300px in admin).

To create:
1. Load index.html in browser
2. Take full-page screenshot
3. Crop/resize to 1200x900px
4. Save as screenshot.png in theme root
5. Delete this file

Or use an image editor to create a branded placeholder with:
- ISN.BIZ logo
- Theme name: "ISN.BIZ 2026"
- Tagline: "Investor-Grade Portfolio Theme"
- Background: Metallic or brand colors (#1E9FF2, #5FDFDF, #3F4447)
