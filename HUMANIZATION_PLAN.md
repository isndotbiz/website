**Before:** "Proven track record of excellence"
**After:** "11 years. Every client still with us. That's not luck—it's delivering what we promise."

### 3. **Use Real Examples**
**Before:** "Leveraging advanced machine learning"
**After:** "Running Qwen 30B locally means your data never leaves your servers. Zero API costs, complete control."

### 4. **Write Like You Talk**
**Before:** "Our comprehensive suite of enterprise solutions"
**After:** "We build software. AI-powered, production-ready, no BS."

### 5. **Get Personal**
**Before:** "Strategic leadership driving innovation"
**After:** "Jonathan's been writing code since high school. Now he runs the company. Some things don't change."
