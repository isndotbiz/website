                              NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (February - March 2026):
  No action required
  - Certificate is valid and trusted
  - Both domains fully covered
  - TLS 1.3 enabled and working
  - Auto-renewal configured with Netlify

APRIL 1, 2026 (Recommended):
  Verification check
  - Verify renewal process has started
  - Check Netlify dashboard for certificate status
  - Run certificate check command (see below)

APRIL 15, 2026 (Expected):
  Auto-renewal in progress
  - Let's Encrypt typically renews 30 days before expiry
  - New certificate should be visible in Netlify
  - No disruption expected

APRIL 26, 2026 (Expiry Date):
  Original certificate expires (no impact)
  - New certificate should be active by this date
  - If something went wrong, this is the emergency date
  - If not renewed by April 20, investigate immediately

================================================================================
                         MONITORING COMMANDS
================================================================================

Quick Status Check (Run monthly):
  openssl s_client -connect isn.biz:443 -servername isn.biz </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates

Verify Certificate Chain:
  openssl s_client -connect isn.biz:443 -servername isn.biz </dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep "Verify return code"
  Expected: "Verify return code: 0 (ok)"

Check TLS Protocol:
  openssl s_client -connect isn.biz:443 -servername isn.biz </dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep "Protocol"
  Expected: "Protocol  : TLSv1.3"

Get Full Certificate Details:
  openssl s_client -connect isn.biz:443 -servername isn.biz </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text

Check Both Domains (One Command):
  for domain in isn.biz www.isn.biz; do echo "=== $domain ==="; openssl s_client -connect $domain:443 -servername $domain </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates; done
