## Prompt Engineering Best Practices (2026)

### Universal Prompt Structure

```
[Subject/Main Element] + [Medium/Style] + [Lighting] + [Framing/Composition] +
[Mood/Atmosphere] + [Color Palette with hex codes] + [Technical Specs] + [Quality Keywords]

Negative: [Elements to avoid]
```

### Model-Specific Approaches

**GPT Image 1.5 (ChatGPT):**
- Use paragraph-style descriptive prompts
- Multi-turn refinement: "Keep X, change Y"
- Explicit text specification
- Works well with conversational editing

**Midjourney v7:**
- Short, high-signal phrases
- Photography terminology: "85mm lens, f/2.8"
- Style references
- Parameter flags: --ar 16:9 --v 7

**Flux 2:**
- Structured detailed prompts
- Hex color codes for brand colors
- Resolution specification
- Negative prompts essential

**Nano Banana Pro:**
- Leverage reasoning with detailed descriptions
- Technical/diagram specifications
- Multi-element compositions
- Data visualization requests

### Essential Elements for Professional Assets

**1. Technical Specifications:**
- Resolution: "2560x1440 resolution", "4K", "high resolution"
- Format hints: "transparent background", "web-optimized"
- Aspect ratio: "16:9 format", "square 1:1"

**2. Quality Descriptors:**
- "Professional", "high quality", "ultra detailed"
- "Photorealistic render", "sharp focus", "crisp edges"
- "Studio lighting", "cinematic", "premium"

**3. Brand Color Precision:**
- Always use hex codes: "#1E9FF2", "#5FDFDF", "#3F4447"
- Specify color relationships: "gradient from X to Y"
- Color roles: "on dark charcoal background", "with blue accents"

**4. Lighting:**
- "Soft natural window light", "cinematic lighting"
- "Studio lighting", "dramatic side lighting"
- "Volumetric lighting", "rim highlights"

**5. Composition:**
- "Wide angle shot", "close-up detail"
- "Centered composition", "rule of thirds"
- "Foreground/background separation"

**6. Style Keywords:**
- "Modern", "minimalist", "clean", "professional"
- "Tech-focused", "futuristic", "contemporary"
- "Corporate", "enterprise-grade", "premium"

### Negative Prompts (Critical)

Always include to avoid common issues:
```
Negative: cluttered, busy, messy, amateur, low quality, blurry,
text, watermarks, logos (unless requested), people (unless requested),
outdated, vintage, cartoonish, unrealistic
```

### Iterative Refinement Strategy

**Initial Generation:**
1. Create 3-5 variations with slightly different prompts
2. Evaluate quality, composition, brand alignment
3. Select best candidate

**Refinement:**
1. Identify specific issues (colors, composition, elements)
2. Adjust prompt with targeted changes
3. Use model-specific editing features when available

**GPT Image 1.5 Refinement:**
```
"Keep the overall composition and colors, but make the background less busy
and move the main element slightly to the left for better balance"
```

**Flux 2 Refinement:**
- Adjust prompt and regenerate
- Use LoRA models for specific styles
- Fine-tune negative prompts

### Advanced Techniques

**1. Color Precision:**
```
Instead of: "blue and cyan colors"
Use: "bright blue #1E9FF2 and cyan #5FDFDF on dark charcoal #3F4447"
```

**2. Layout Control:**
```
"Split-layout design: left 55% contains headline and CTA,
right 45% features hero illustration"
```

**3. Text Integration (GPT Image 1.5/Nano Banana Pro):**
```
'Large bold text reading "isn.biz" centered at top in modern sans-serif font,
supporting text below reading "Custom Software Solutions" in smaller weight'
```

**4. Style Consistency:**
- Save successful prompts as templates
- Maintain consistent keyword patterns
- Use same quality descriptors across asset types

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Color Accuracy Problems

**Issue:** Generated colors don't match brand palette

**Solutions:**
1. Always specify hex codes in prompts: "#1E9FF2"
2. Use Flux 2 Pro for best color precision
3. Post-process with color adjustments if needed
4. Verify monitor calibration

**Example Fix:**
```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

def adjust_brand_colors(image_path):
    """Adjust colors to match brand palette"""
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    # Color adjustment logic
    return adjusted_img
```

### Quality Issues

**Issue:** Output looks amateurish or low quality

**Solutions:**
1. Add quality keywords: "professional, high quality, ultra detailed"
2. Increase resolution in prompt
3. Use higher-tier services (Flux 2 Pro, GPT Image 1.5)
4. Add negative prompts: "amateur, low quality, blurry"

### Text Rendering Problems

**Issue:** Text in generated images is illegible

**Solutions:**
1. Use GPT Image 1.5 or Nano Banana Pro (best text rendering)
2. Specify text explicitly: "text reading 'isn.biz' in large bold font"
3. Request higher contrast
4. Consider adding text in post-processing

### Consistency Problems

**Issue:** Assets don't have consistent style

**Solutions:**
1. Use same service for similar asset types
2. Maintain consistent prompt structure
3. Save and reuse successful prompt templates
4. Generate sets in single session
5. Use same quality keywords across all prompts

### API Issues

**Issue:** Rate limits, timeouts, or errors

**Solutions:**
1. Implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. Batch requests with delays
3. Use multiple API keys if allowed
4. Monitor usage and costs
5. Cache successful generations
