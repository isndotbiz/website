- [ ] File format correct (PNG for transparency, JPG for photos, SVG for vectors)

**Brand:**
- [ ] Colors match isn.biz brand palette
- [ ] Style consistent with brand guidelines

## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

### "Image looks AI-generated"
**Fix:** Use FLUX.2 or Midjourney V7, add "professional photography" to prompt, enhance with LetsEnhance

### "Text in image is garbled"
**Fix:** Use FLUX.2 (best text rendering), specify "legible text, clean typography"

### "Colors don't match brand"
**Fix:** Specify exact hex codes in prompt, use reference images, adjust in post-processing

### "Character/person looks different in each image"
**Fix:** Use FLUX.2 multi-reference (up to 10 images), OpenArt Character Profiles, or Midjourney --cref

### "Generation is too expensive"
**Fix:** Start with FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] ($0.015), iterate, then upgrade to premium for finals

### "Video is too short"
**Fix:** Use Runway Gen-3 Video-to-Video (20 sec), or stitch multiple Pika clips

### "Results don't match prompt"
**Fix:** Be more specific, use few-shot examples, try different models, iterate prompt
