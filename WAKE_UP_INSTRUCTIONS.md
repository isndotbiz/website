## ⏳ OPTIONAL: Photo Enhancement (When You Want)

**Why it's optional:**
The site is already INCREDIBLE with 24 business visuals. But if you want 10 MORE photos (community outreach + neck fixes), run:

```bash
# Make sure you're on 10.0.0.0/24 network or have FAL_KEY set
./RUN_ALL_SCRIPTS.sh
```

**This generates:**
- 8 community outreach team photos
- 2 neck proportion fixes (Lilly & Bri)

**Time:** 10-15 minutes
**Cost:** ~$1.00-$1.50

**Why it didn't run last night:**
Pip install was still running when you went to bed. It's probably done now!
