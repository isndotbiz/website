## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Backslash vs Forward Slash (Windows Path Separator)

**Problem:** HTML contains `\` instead of `/` in S3 URLs

**Example:**
```html
<!-- WRONG -->
<img src="https://isnbiz-assets-1769962280.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets/founders\headshots_with_bg/alicia_headshot.webp">

<!-- CORRECT -->
<img src="https://isnbiz-assets-1769962280.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets/founders/headshots_with_bg/alicia_headshot.webp">
```

**Root Cause:** Likely generated on Windows, using `os.path.join()` or similar which uses backslashes

**Fix:** Global find/replace `\` → `/` in all S3 URLs across all founder pages

**Files Affected:**
- alicia.html
- bri.html
- jonathan.html
- lilly.html
- index.html (founder headshots section)

---

### Issue 2: Missing S3 Directories/Files

**Missing Directories:**
1. `premium_v3/portfolio/` - Home page portfolio preview images
2. `premium_v3/projects/` - Portfolio page project images
3. `assets/founders/headshots_with_bg/` - Most founder headshots
4. `assets/founders/corporate_photos/` - Corporate style photos
5. `assets/founders/casual_variants/` - Casual style photos

**What Exists (Working Images):**
- `premium_v3/icons/` - Working (about.html, investors.html pass)
- `assets/backgrounds/` - Working (slider-gallery.html passes)
- Individual project pages - Working (all 8 pass)

**Recommendation:** Check S3 bucket contents, upload missing files

---

### Issue 3: Duplicate URL Prefix in portfolio-grid.html

**Problem:** URLs have doubled S3 bucket URLs

**Bad URL:**
```
https://isnbiz-assets-1769962280.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/premium_v3/https://isnbiz-assets-1769962280.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets/projects/truenas_1.webp
```

**Should Be:**
```
https://isnbiz-assets-1769962280.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets/projects/truenas_1.webp
```

**Fix:** Remove `premium_v3/` prefix from image sources in portfolio-grid.html

---

### Issue 4: Relative Paths Instead of S3 URLs

**Found in:**
- bri.html: `assets/founders/bri_office_work.webp`
- bri.html: `assets/founders/bri_strategic_planning.webp`
- lilly.html: `assets/founders/lilly_office_work.webp`
- lilly.html: `assets/founders/lilly_presentation.webp`

**Fix:** Replace relative paths with full S3 URLs

---

## Priority Fixes

### Priority 1: CRITICAL (Breaks All Founder Pages)

**Fix Backslashes in Founder Pages**

Run global find/replace in these files:
- alicia.html
- bri.html
- jonathan.html
- lilly.html
- index.html

Replace: `founders\` → `founders/`

**Script:**
```bash
cd D:/workspace/ISNBIZ_Files
sed -i 's|founders\\|founders/|g' alicia.html bri.html jonathan.html lilly.html index.html
```

---

### Priority 2: HIGH (Breaks Home & Portfolio)

**Upload Missing S3 Files**

Check local directories:
```bash
# Check if files exist locally
ls -la assets/founders/headshots_with_bg/
ls -la assets/founders/corporate_photos/
ls -la assets/founders/casual_variants/
ls -la assets/premium_v3/portfolio/
ls -la assets/premium_v3/projects/
```

Upload to S3:
```bash
# Upload founder photos
aws s3 cp assets/founders/ s3://isnbiz-assets-1769962280/assets/founders/ --recursive

# Upload portfolio images
aws s3 cp assets/premium_v3/portfolio/ s3://isnbiz-assets-1769962280/premium_v3/portfolio/ --recursive

# Upload project images
aws s3 cp assets/premium_v3/projects/ s3://isnbiz-assets-1769962280/premium_v3/projects/ --recursive
```

---

### Priority 3: MEDIUM (Breaks Portfolio Grid)

**Fix Duplicate URL Prefix in portfolio-grid.html**

Edit portfolio-grid.html, find all instances of:
```
premium_v3/https://isnbiz-assets...
```

Replace with:
```
https://isnbiz-assets...
```

---

### Priority 4: LOW (4 Images in Bri/Lilly)

**Replace Relative Paths with S3 URLs**

In bri.html:
```html
<!-- Replace -->
assets/founders/bri_office_work.webp
assets/founders/bri_strategic_planning.webp

<!-- With -->
https://isnbiz-assets-1769962280.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets/founders/corporate_photos/bri_working.webp
https://isnbiz-assets-1769962280.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets/founders/corporate_photos/bri_strategy.webp
```

In lilly.html:
```html
<!-- Replace -->
assets/founders/lilly_office_work.webp
assets/founders/lilly_presentation.webp

<!-- With -->
https://isnbiz-assets-1769962280.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets/founders/corporate_photos/lilly_working.webp
https://isnbiz-assets-1769962280.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets/founders/corporate_photos/lilly_presenting.webp
```

## Testing Commands

### Run Full Test Suite Again
```bash
cd D:/workspace/ISNBIZ_Files
python test_website.py
```

### Test Single Page
```bash
# Modify test_website.py to test specific page
python -c "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright; p = sync_playwright().start(); browser = p.chromium.launch(); page = browser.new_page(); page.goto('https://isn.biz/alicia.html'); page.screenshot(path='test.png'); browser.close()"
```

### Check S3 Bucket Contents
```bash
# List all founder photos
aws s3 ls s3://isnbiz-assets-1769962280/assets/founders/ --recursive

# List all premium_v3 assets
aws s3 ls s3://isnbiz-assets-1769962280/premium_v3/ --recursive
```

## Expected Outcome After Fixes

If all fixes are applied:
- **Home Page:** 14/14 images ✅
- **Portfolio:** 10/10 images ✅
- **Portfolio Grid:** 5/5 images ✅
- **Alicia:** 8/8 images ✅
- **Bri:** 8/8 images ✅
