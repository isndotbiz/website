WHAT YOU'RE MISSING (WITHOUT PROXY)
==============================================================================

Your Investor Website (isn.biz) currently has NO:
  ✗ DDoS attack protection
  ✗ Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  ✗ Global CDN (content delivery network)
  ✗ Automatic caching
  ✗ Bot attack protection
  ✗ Rate limiting
  ✗ Your real IP is exposed to attackers (73.140.158.252)

This means:
  - 1-minute DDoS attack could take your site down
  - Bots can brute force your login forms
  - No automatic defense against common web attacks
  - Slow page loads for international visitors
  - High bandwidth consumption


WHAT YOU'LL GET (WITH PROXY ENABLED)
==============================================================================

After enabling Cloudflare proxy for isn.biz:
  ✓ Automatic DDoS protection at edge
  ✓ Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  ✓ Global CDN - faster loads for all visitors (30-50% faster)
  ✓ Automatic bandwidth reduction (30-40%)
  ✓ Bot detection and blocking
  ✓ Rate limiting and traffic management
  ✓ Your real server IP remains hidden
  ✓ Better security posture
  ✓ No additional cost (free plan includes these)


QUESTIONS ABOUT TODAY'S CHANGES
==============================================================================

Both root domain records were MODIFIED TODAY (2026-02-02):
  - isn.biz: modified 07:56:05 UTC
  - www.isn.biz: modified 07:56:06 UTC

These changes DISABLED Cloudflare protection (proxied: false)

This raises questions:
  1. Was this intentional?
  2. Was this accidental/unexpected?
  3. Who made these changes?
  4. Should protection be restored?

Recommendation: Re-enable protection unless there was a specific reason
for disabling it.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
==============================================================================

STEP 1: Enable Cloudflare Proxy for isn.biz

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Login with your Cloudflare account
3. Select isn.biz domain
4. Click DNS tab
5. Find "isn.biz" A record (should show 73.140.158.252)
6. Click the cloud icon next to it (gray cloud → orange cloud)
7. Save changes

Estimated time: 2-3 minutes


STEP 2: Enable Cloudflare Proxy for www.isn.biz

1. Find "www.isn.biz" A record in DNS tab
2. Click cloud icon (gray cloud → orange cloud)
3. Save changes

Estimated time: 1-2 minutes


STEP 3: Remove Duplicate rag.isn.biz Record

1. In DNS tab, find all "rag.isn.biz" records (should be 2)
2. Decide which to keep:
   - Option A: Keep 10.0.0.89 (internal) → Delete 73.140.158.252
   - Option B: Keep 73.140.158.252 (external) → Delete 10.0.0.89
3. Click delete (trash icon) on the one you don't want
4. Confirm deletion

Estimated time: 2-3 minutes


STEP 4: Verify Changes

Wait 1-2 minutes for DNS propagation, then:

  nslookup isn.biz
  Expected: Should return 73.140.158.252 (or Cloudflare IP if proxied)

  nslookup www.isn.biz
  Expected: Should return 73.140.158.252 (or Cloudflare IP if proxied)

  nslookup rag.isn.biz
  Expected: Should return ONLY ONE IP (not two)

Total verification time: 2-3 minutes


TOTAL TIME COMMITMENT: ~10-15 minutes
